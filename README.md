Reflection:
I focused on applying simplicity and consistency throughout the portfolio to ensure a clean and intuitive user experience. The layout is responsive to accommodate different screen sizes, enhancing accessibility. I used clear typography and contrasting colors to improve readability and guide the userâ€™s attention to important sections.

Challenges and Solutions

One challenge was ensuring the portfolio looked good on both mobile and desktop devices. Initially, the layout broke on smaller screens, so I implemented media queries and flexible grid systems to make it fully responsive. Another issue was balancing visual appeal with fast loading times; I optimized images and kept CSS concise to improve performance.

Future Improvements

Next, I plan to add interactive elements like animations or transitions to make the site more engaging without overwhelming users. I also want to include a blog or case studies section to provide deeper insights into my projects and thought process. Finally, integrating more advanced accessibility features will ensure the site is usable by a wider audience.
